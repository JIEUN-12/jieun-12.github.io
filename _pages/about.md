ðŸŽ“ Hi, I'm Jieun Lee, a PhD graduate in Computer Science from Yonsei University.
My research focuses on DBMS (e.g., RocksDB, Spark, Redis, PostgreSQL, and MySQL) and AI-driven optimization techniques, particularly Bayesian optimization, deep learning, and machine learning. Recently, I have also developed an interest in LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and vector DBMSs.

ðŸš€ I am currently exploring postdoctoral opportunities, aiming for a future in academia.
